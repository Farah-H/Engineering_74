# Time and Task Management

## Why is time management important? 

Examples of poor time management include: 
- lack of punctuality 
- failure to complete tasks on time, either individually or as a member of a team 

Lack of time-management is not professional and makes it unlikely that you survive long at a company. Time management is the utilisation of skills, tools and techniques to accomplish specific tasks, projects and ultimately goals. 


## Why is task management improtant?
 
 __Task management is the process of managing a task during its lifecycle including  planning, tracking and reporting__

Cycle of task mgmt: 

-> Focus -> Prioritise Well -> Set Time-Boundaries -> organise routine -> plan ahead 


## Eisenthower principle

| Task        | Urgent       | Not urgent   |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Important    | Do | Schedule |
| Not Important      | Delegate  |  Eliminate  |

What is important is seldolm urgent, and what is urgent is seldom important.
