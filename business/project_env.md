# __Project Environment__

## Project vs BAU

Business as usual is basic day-to-day operations and structure that keep the company running.BAU is ongoing. 

Projects follow usual BAU timing and structure, e.g starting time, building location etc. but the specifics differ. Projects are unique and transient with a desired outcome. 

__Contained projects can be outside of BAU__

## Project Cycle:

1. Initiation
2. Planning 
3. Execution
4. Monitoring and Controlling 
5. Closing

## Project Constraints

    Dependancies, many companies use this because it was they started projects and can't switch. In this , you CAN'T TEST until you are done coding.

## Why do projects fail? 
- Waterfall, problems show up too late
- lack of communication with client 
- Lack of teamwork & other issues

### Attributes of Mature Teams
- Co-Located
- Cross Functional Roles (DEVOPS)
    - DevOps needs to understand different aspects of the business because they bridge the gap between deployment and development. 
- Self-Organising
- Accountable and Empowered
- Test and learn feedback loops

### Projects are Difficult! 

- Create a *positive* atmosphere
- manage conflict *intelligently*
- have open and clear *communication*
- *respect* all your peers
- become *trustworthy*


## Departments:

- BA: Business Admin
- QA: Quality Assurance
- DEV: Development
- PM: Project Management
- UX: Front End

## Business Case:
 
 A justification for the proposed project needed to obtain authorisation from the Board. It includes:
 - Expected benifits (ROI)
 - Execution Timeline
 - Executive Summary
 - Investment Appraisal
 - Solutions / Options
 - Major Risks
 - Stakeholder management / Communication plan

 It also includes initiation and requirement gathering. 

 __STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT IS IMPORTANT__

 A stakeholder is everyone who has got something to do with your business e.g client, project manager

 The idea is what makes you money, if it has already been implemented, competition in the market this means there is a risk.

 ## ROI 

 Comes fown to the worth of the product to the people who need it. Need to understand basic terms like cashflow, pay back etc. 

 ## Risk 
 
 ### Why is it important to identify risk early in any project?
 
To be better equipped to handle it, and to include arrangements for managing risks within your timeline. 

Sources of risk:
- Technology
- Team
- Scope
- Business
- Economy
- Competition


### Dealing with Risk:
- Avoid 
- Transfer (Hedging)
- Reduce
- Accept
- Exploit design to mitigate risk
- Share the risk with others 
- Enhance by modifying risk exposure
- Ignore
    - only if you can provide justification e.g if the risk has a negligible probability. 


## Stake-Holders: 

![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/767793850529087489/768479687977467974/unknown.png)

Manage stakeholders by keeping the most important people in the loop and happy. You need to:
1. Identify a stakeholder's interest and importance 
2. Act accordingly

### Stakeholder Attitudes
- Champions 
    Fight for project cause 
- Supporters
    support the project and speak favourably
- Neutral people
    are fine either way 
- Critic
    will be negative, needs to be convinved to be on the project's side
- opponent
    will find reasons to give you a hard time
- blockers
    actively block progress
