## STAR
### Benifits of using STAR:

- s: situation 
- T: Task
- A: Action

STAR is a way of structuring answers in interviews. **articulate your answers using STAR with examples**

Why why why 

__Why is the interviewer interested in this format ?__
The way you behaved at your previous organisation gives them insight into how you will behave at their role.
They want your claims 'i am passionate/hard working etc.' to be backed up by *evidence* in the form of real situations that have happened. 



# What is Elevator's Pitch (TMY)
__'Tell me about yourself.'__ is usually the first question you will be asked in an interview. It is an opportunity to sell yourself from the get-go. 

```
Task
```
Create an Elevator's pitch for maximum 1 min. It needs to include:
- Introduction
- Your background
    - if your background is not in Tech, why the switch?
- Key / Recent Achievements
- Why DevOps?
- Deliver in a professional manner / positive attitude.
