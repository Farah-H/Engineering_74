## Critical Thinking Process:
1. __Identify__:
- Main points of the argument
- Claims being made
- Evidence used
- The conclusions reached
2. __Analyse__:
- Does the information make sense in relation to other research?
- How old is the material? 
- Is the material clear or do you need to find additional info to aid understanding?
- Is the argument balanced or biased? are there any topics which are disregarded? 
3. __Apply__:
- Consider the implications of other information
- What are the weaknesses when applied to a real-life situation?
- Is there a lack of coverage? 



## 3 Modes of Thinking:
- Divergent
> Imagination Oriented:
>>queation -> idea -> question -> idea -> question etc.
- Convergent 
>Logic Oriented:
>>fact -> answer -> fact -> answer etc.
- Lateral

### What Kind of Questions Might We Ask?
Start with open questions to open the conversation, can move to leading questions to probe more, or for specifics. 

- What is the source of the evidence?
- What are the kinds of claims being made?
- Where is the evidence?
- Strengths and weaknesses of the evidence
- Is it a balanced argument?
- Do we understand the background / context?

__DO NOT MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS__

## How to Structure an Argument:
1. **_Claim_**: Present your argument in a clear statement
2. **_Evidence_**: Present evidence to support your claim
3. **_Impact_**: Explain the significance of the evidence

## Evaluating an Argument:
- Alternative arguments
- Supporting evidence
    - Quality of data + quality of interpretation

### What If We Want to Challenge an Argument?

- Debating Etiquette:
    - Acknowledge the other person's view before challenging them (LISTEN)
    - Be constructive.
    - Reflect on the arguments' strengths.
    - Think about your language, be respectful and consider whether you risk being offensive.


## Logical Fallacies:
- False dichotomy: when speaker forces a debate into two sides
- Assertion: when speaker presents assumption as fact
- Morally flawed
- correlation being used interchangeably with causation
- failure to deliver promises
- straw man
- contradiction
- compare to reality
