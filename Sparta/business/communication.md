# Communication 

## Communication Principles 
- Everything we do is a form of communication
- Delivery affects the message 
- The real message is the one recieved, not the one intended 
- it is a one-way street 

## How can poor communication affect business?

- Lack of teamwork 
- Can create tension
- lack of precision leads to confusion and ultimately frustration
- Damage to corporate image, lack of professionalism / accountability 

__What are the barriers to good communication?__

Organisational, personal, cultural 

## How can we mitigate / avoid miscommunication? 

- Don't stereotype
- Be open to ideas outside your existing beliefs
- stay level-headed and treat people with respect
- Try not to take things personal or make things personal
- Speak politely, create an environment that thrives on positivity, celebration etc. 

## Cognitive biases 

__Can be consious or unconsious. 'The mind is an operating system' it doesn't always work perfectly. there are always hidden flaws, backdoors hacks etc.__

## Exploiting Bias in the Workplace

- Reactance: if they can say no they are more likely to say yes
- reciprocity - give, it makes others more likely to give to you
- door in the face: people are more likely to agree to a small request after rejecting a larger one
- likeability: if people like you they are going to be more wiling to help you 
- social proof

### Other Biases:

- Halo effect: if you are seen as competent at something, people will precieve you to be better at other things than you actually are, your positive impression from one aspect __seeps__ into other things

To exploit: don't slack, even if something is small / insignificant, put in work and demonstrate your competence, it will lead others to think you are more compentent in other, more important, areas. 



- Blind spot bias: we don't believe we are biased. 

To overcome: listen to feedback and question your own thoughts, where is this thought coming from? could it be the result of bias? Be humble, accept that we are human and we all have biases.
