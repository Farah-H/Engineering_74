# Communication 

## Communication Principles

Organisational, personal, cultural 

## How can we mitigate / avoid miscommunication? 

- Don't stereotype
- Be open to ideas outside your existing beliefs
- stay level-headed and treat people with respect
- Try not to take things personal or make things personal
- Speak politely, create an environment that thrives on positivity, celebration etc. 

## Cognitive biases 

__Can be consious or unconsious. 'The mind is an operating system' it doesn't always work perfectly. there are always hidden flaws, backdoors hacks etc.__

- door in the face: people are more likely to agree to a small request after rejecting a larger one
